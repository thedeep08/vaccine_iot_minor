		COVID-19 virus, knows as novel coronavirus, has spread all over
		the world.  World Health Organisation (WHO), marked
		11\textsuperscript{th} March, 2020 as the day when COVID19 was
		declared as pandemic. It, was first
		originated in Wuhan, China.
		In recent days, Covid19 caused an immense impact on various
		social and economic fiels in the world.
		It is necesssary to
		quantify its spread and make predictions on how it is going to
		affect the world in coming months.
		In this paper, our aim is to use linear
		regression and LSTM algorithms to forecast of Covid19 spread.
		The objective of this study is to determine if spread can be
		forecasted to better accuracy using linear regression and LSTM
		algortihms.

		KeyWords: Machine Learning, Linear Regression, LSTM, Mean
		Absolute Error, COVID-19
