\begin{abstract}
COVID-19 virus, knows as novel coronavirus, has spread all over
the world.  World Health Organisation (WHO), marked
11\textsuperscript{th} March, 2020 as the day when COVID19 was
declared as pandemic. It, was first
originated in Wuhan, China.
In recent days, Covid19 caused an immense impact on various
social and economic fiels in the world.
It is necesssary to
quantify its spread and make predictions on how it is going to
affect the world in coming months.
In this paper, our aim is to use linear
regression and LSTM algorithms to forecast of Covid19 spread.
The objective of this study is to determine if spread can be
forecasted to better accuracy using linear regression and LSTM
algortihms.
